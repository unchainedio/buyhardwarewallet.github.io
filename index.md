# Keep your bitcoins secure

Hardware wallet is the modern equivalent of the most secure bank vaults that people used to store their valuables. Since we're living in the 21^st^ century, cryptocurrencies have gained value formerly held by gold or paper money. However, this has created the need for an entirely different way of protection from theft.

Bitcoin is a currency that needs to be protected in a different way than traditional money. It's your responsibility to ensure your bitcoin (and other altcoin that you might have) are protected. Since bitcoin transactions are decentralized transactions between individuals or organizations, you don't have the protection that traditional banks offer, in case there's something wrong with your transactions.

However, Bitcoin network and its organization can work smoothly and flawlessly for you if you just include a bit of common sense, organization and proper hardware.

# Hot vs. Cold Storage

You have two basic ways to store your bitcoins, cold and hot storage. Hot storage is created trough specialized software bitcoin wallets used on devices that are connected to the internet, such as tablets, mobile phones or tables. They're inevitably associated with a certain risk from theft because a device connected to the internet might be exposed to viruses, malware or spyware. They should be used only for smaller purchases and you shouldn't load them with the amount of bitcoin you can't afford to lose.

Cold storage keeps your Bitcoin private keys safe by creating and storing them offline. This removes the risk from internet based attack.
There are three types of cold storage: paper wallets, hardware wallets, and software wallets run on offline computers. Cold storage is analogous to your traditional savings account, you keep bitcoin you don't plan to spend immediately there.

If you keep your software wallet on an offline computer, you're not going to be able to make any transactions on the go, so this makes it a bit impractical. Also, your hard drive is always under the inevitable risk of becoming corrupt, but if you decide to backup your private keys to a claud, you defeat the purpose of offline computer cold storage.

Paper wallets are also a tricky option, because your private keys might be stolen in the moment you're creating them, if the company that provides this service to you doesn't have adequate security.
