#Hardware wallet KeepKey
If you are looking for a different and unique experience with your hardware wallet (link it), look no further. With its pretty design and many great features, what separates KeepKey from other hardware wallets, such as Tresor (link it), is its simplicity that comes with the highest level of security you can get. KeepKey is one of the newest hardware wallets on the market and it’s constantly improving.

#Why KeepKey?
With its very affordable price and great performance capabilities, KeepKey is a device which will secure and store your Bitcoins. Device is simple to use and it only requires USB cable for connection with your computer. Its smooth OLED display will grant you a clearer view about your transactions thus making you more certain you are not making a mistake. 
#How does KeepKey keep your bitcoins safe?
There are a few ways KeepKey ensures the safety of your bitcoins:
KeepKey doesn’t have an operating system which means that it cannot be corrupted by any virus, malware or key logger. Hackers that want to steal your information or even your money simply don’t have a way to reach your essential data through the device.
Multi-level security system continues with unique PIN protection of your device and unusual way of PIN entering. Every time you plug in the device, the order of numbers on the screen changes in randomized way which makes it impossible for key loggers to record your PIN.
There is a built in Recovery system so when you initialize your device for the first time you will be given a chance to set it up. Recovery system is consisted of 12 different yet specific words which you can write (in the same order they are shown on the screen!) on provided card and use it afterwards if recovery is needed.
Your private key is used for the transaction on the KeepKey itself and it never reaches the internet, so your bitcoins are safe even if you use KeepKey on a computer with compromised safety.
#How does KeepKey work?
Because the KeepKey doesn’t have any operating system in it, you won’t even need drivers for it to work! Once you connect it with any other device (PC, Linux, MAC, Android) using provided USB cable, it will start working immediately.
KeepKey is supported by Chrome browser and for the best experience with it, you will have to download two applications for Chrome which are added as extensions. One application makes it possible for Chrome to connect with the KeepKey device and other one generates your KeepKey wallet.
Your Bitcoin private number is randomly generated using two-end system: one end being randomization by KeepKey itself and other end being randomization provided by your computer. Once it’s generated, it’s stored safely on the device and never leaves it ensuring the security of every transaction. Every transaction must be verified manually using confirmation button on the KeepKey device.
#Did you hear the news?
KeepKey will start collaborating with Shapeshift exchange. What this means for KeepKey users is that they will be able to exchange various types of supported altcoins using their hardware wallets. Best part about this future upgrade is the fact that these transactions will be done offline without ever exposing your private key online.
This feature is still in testing but we hope it will soon be on the market.
