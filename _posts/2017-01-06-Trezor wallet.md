# Hardware wallet Trezor
Now that we’ve learned what [hardware wallets](http://buyhardwarewallet.com/hardwarewallet)  are, we have to make sure we’ve chosen the correct one that keeps our bitcoins safe. With the increase of popularity and value of bitcoins the system has found itself under attack of many hackers. In order to protect your bitcoins from theft you will want to consider Trezor.

## What is Trezor?
Trezor is a small, fancy device, extremely easy and convenient to use and it helps you control your money and transactions easily. Trezor has a built in display and two keys which you press to confirm your transactions thus making your transactions verified and completely safe. It can be easily connected to your computer using just the USB cable provided with the device and a big advantage is that it works on any operating system ( Windows, Linux, Os X ). It can also be used in a mode that allows you to view your transactions only and not make any new ones. USB-on-the-go technique is being developed, and your Trezor is expected to work with tablets or mobile phones soon.  

## What’s the science behind Trezor?
Imagine Trezor to be a pencil you would use to sign some papers at the bank. Now, imagine if that pencil transformed your signature into various types of modern cryptographic algorithms making it some sort of your own private key. Wouldn’t that be cool?
So, what is preventing your handwriting and signature from unauthorized copying is the fact that Trezor generates private keys which never leave the device making them unreachable for any type of malware. Trezor can generate infinite number of private keys ensuring your transactions are safe.
If you are worried that the computer you’ve used with Trezor might be compromised in any way,  your bitcoin won’t be affected. Trezor has an uncommon way of PIN generating and entering thus making it extremely hard for key loggers to record it, since you won’t be typing in your PIN directly, you’ll choose it from a series of numeric screens which keep changing the position of certain numbers.
When you first initialize your Trezor you can set up your own Recovery seed so in case your device gets stolen, lost or broken it’s easy to recover your entire information. Recovery seed is usually consisted of 18, 21 or 24 words that you will use in case recovery is needed. Once you decide which words you will use, you will write them down on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe since they are very important for your Trezor account. You can even order your recovery seed to be engraved in a steel plate, making it fire resistant and almost indestructible.

Here are some of the Trezor’s many features:
- If you plan to go swimming, you can take your Trezor with you since it’s waterproof.
