*Hardware wallets* are not just another unnecessary fancy gadget. They are irreplacable for people who need to keep their cryptocurrencies safe.


# Advantages of bitcoin

Bitcoin are the world's first and most successful cryptocurrency. They are global and decentralized, which means they are not under control from a central bank and their value can't be arbitrairly changed. Only 21,000,000 bitcoins ever will be created through a complex process of solving mathematical equations, called mining. This means, unlike standard currencies, that can be printed indefinetely which will make them lose value over time, bitcoin can be reasonably expected to gain value over time.

Bitcoin transactions work using an open transaction ledger called the 'Blockchain'. All transaction data existing on the network is recorded on the blockchain. Every new mined block is added to the blockchain and confirmed. The blockchain is then downloaded by every bitcoin adress user's wallet making the change irreversible. This means that the transaction history is impossible to be changed retroactively and that also offers many interesting possibilities. Smart contracts are being developed, and they can include ownership information along with the record of money exchange in blockchain.

Another interesting detail, that is probably attractive to many users is the anonymity of bitcoin transaction. Only you control the bitcoins you own, as long as you have their public key without the need to provide your name and other private information. You don't have to involve banks or any other third parties so the transaction costs are non-existent or extremely low. No third party can cancel or alter your transaction.

#How do i store my bitcoin?

You don't store the bitcoin themselves, to be absolutely precise, they're safe on a blockchain. However, you'll need a way to store the private key that gives you access to a bitcoin address and enables you to use your money. You can choose different ways to protect your private keys but if you have larger amounts of bitcoin you really need to make sure security is optimal.

Today, five main types of bitcoin wallets are in use:

1. desktop
2. mobile
3. web
4. paper
5. hardware.

Desktop and mobile wallets are useful for smaller amounts of bitcoin, but their disadvantage is that the risk of  hardware failure is always present and your bitcoin might be lost if your computer's hard drive or your phone are damaged. You need to make sure to do regular backups if you use this type of storage.

Web-based storage keeps your private keys online using a specialized online service. This type of storage is not recommended if you have larger amounts of bitcoin because there's always a risk of software attack and theft of your private data.

Paper wallets are a service that some online providers offer. They will create you two QR codes, one with your bitcoin address and the other with your private key. You need to make sure to keep them physically safe, which might be impractical sometimes.

[Hardware wallets](http://buyhardwarewallet.com/hardwarewallet) are the recommended way to keep your bitcoin safe, especially if you own significant amount of them. You use specialized hardware to keep your bitcoin private keys safe offline. Hardware wallets are impossible to hack and offer you complete security.

You should check out several types of hardware wallets we've reviewed to find the most suitable one for yourself. Different manufacturers offer different options and some of them support other forms of cryptocurrencies as well as bitcoin.
