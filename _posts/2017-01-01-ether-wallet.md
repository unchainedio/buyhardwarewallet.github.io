# The Ethereum platform
Before we start talking about Ethereum, we need to get acquainted with the concept of smart contracts and what do they stand for. Smart contracts are basically applications/transactions that cannot be censored, used for frauds or messed up by any third parties since they are a part of blockchain which is impossible to manipulate retroactively. Ethereum app must run exactly as it's programmed. Ethereum is a decentralized platform which uses the concept of smart contracts. It's intended for individuals and decentralized organizations who need a way to create secure transactions without middlemen and meddling from other organizations such as banks or attorneys.

# What's the use for Ethereum?

For an application to work on classic server architecture, it needs to have a lot of behind the scene elements, for example, its own servers, making the information sharing harder than necessary. Another problem can occur once anything in the system breaks down and creates a chain reaction that causes downfall of other applications thus affecting usability of application for other users. Letâ€™s not forget the problems with all kinds of malicious software attacks that can happen.

Using Ethereum, your smart contracts are incorporated into a custom built blockchain which basically represents the ownership of the property and allows you to move your values across globally shared infrastructure. Once the node is set up on the blockchain, it can replicate crucial data for all nodes to reach an agreement. This allows developers to create a lot of interesting apps that can be set up to automatically perform certain transactions as soon as certain criteria are met. All this happens without the interference of any third party but with the high levels of safety that come from the blockchain technology itself. Tokens used to create the smart contracts on Ethereum platform are called Ether and their value is constantly growing, similar to bitcoin.
# Ethereum wallet
Ethereum is the glue which holds together blockhain and all smart contracts, but to get access to it, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet and some ethers in it. Ethereum wallet keeps your currencies safe, such as Ether and many other crypto-currencies supported by Ethereum. Having a Ethereum wallet means that you can write, deploy or use smart contracts as you please.

Ether ican be bought on various altcoin exchanges  but currently you can only store Ether on one hardware wallet, Ethereum hardware wallet. Nevertheless, there are many companies working on imaking the Ether  a part of their crypto-currency system. Some familiar Bitcoin hardware wallets, such as [Trezor](http://buyhardwarewallet.com/trezor-wallet) are in the process of integrating Ether and most probably you will only need to update them so that you can store your Ether. [Ledger Nano S ](http://buyhardwarewallet.com/ledger-wallet) and [KeepKey](http://buyhardwarewallet.com/keepkey-wallet) support different kinds of alt coins and it's reasonable to expect they'll include Ether too, since this is the technology of the future.
